What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    some pros of manually choosing when to commint , like we do in git are as folows:
    1. It describes the purpose of commit.
    2. It  shows the different changes done within the file history.
    3. It is easy to track the changes which is done.
    4. easily managable.

    some cons of manually choosing when to create commit , like in we do in git are as follows:
    1. It seems as an extra works.
    2. It should se done carefully ortherwise it will become hetic .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Because Git's file are interconnected with each other like HTML and CSS file , so changes done in one file is absorbed by other also. It does not works on each file seperataly like other version controls do for eg. google doc.
